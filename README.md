## 🌍 What is OpenArena?

**OpenArena** is an open-source platform that lets anyone publish a dataset, create an AI challenge, and track submissions through a transparent, on-chain leaderboard — powered by [Irys](https://www.irys.xyz/).

Inspired by platforms like Kaggle, OpenArena brings the spirit of open experimentation to the decentralized space, with a focus on:

- Transparent, verifiable submissions
- Community-driven challenges
- Decentralized data storage (via Irys)
- Portable, on-chain participation reputation (future)

## 🚀 What can you do (v0 goal)?

In the first version, OpenArena will let you:

1. Upload a dataset (CSV, JSON...) to Irys
2. Create a public challenge with a description, metric, and deadline
3. Accept and display manual submissions
4. Show a simple leaderboard based on score
